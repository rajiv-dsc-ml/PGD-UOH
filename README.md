# PGD-UOH
The repository contains all the assignments under I have come across under this diploma program of University of Hyderabad. 
The credit of issuing the problems (can be termed "non-trivial") as assignments goes to Applied Roots team.

To give my point of view from someone who solved them, these assignments test basics by posing challenges such as, implementing Logistic Regression from scratch with L1 and L2 regularizer, implementing Tf-idf vectors from scratch, Clustering algorithm in graphical data, writing some challenging SQL qeuries, and more .. The variety of assignments are as diverse as the subject of Machine Learning itself is. 

Objective : These assignments are really have helped me to get familiar with algorithms and nature of algorithms in a way which using direct package would not have. I am posting them here so that people who want to learn Machine Learning can find some help and insights from my work I have put in to solve them. 

Request: To students of Applied Roots who have come across similar questions as assignments: Please donot copy and paste the codes. Please see the solutions, only after you have done them yourselves.
