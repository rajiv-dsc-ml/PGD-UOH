The notebook shows power of one dimensional convolutional nueral network in classification task when it comes to text data
The goal: given a document, a text file, identify the category it belongs
There are 20 categories. Some of them are : politics, sports..
We leverage an architecture based on 1 dimensional convolutions to basically get useful features from sequential data and use it for classification.
Note that in a text, words share spatial relation and that makes it sequential in nature.
