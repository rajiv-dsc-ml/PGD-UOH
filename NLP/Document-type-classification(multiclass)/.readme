1. There are a total of 20 types of documents(Text files) and total 18828 documents(text files).
2. There is documents.rar file 
3. If you unzip that, you will get total of 18828 documnets. document name is defined as'ClassLabel_DocumentNumberInThatLabel'. 
4. The task is to classify all the documents into any one of the classes.
5. Each document contains some specific kinds of information like emails mentioned, subjects mentioned and importantly long texts written in the document.
6. These specific kinds of information are used as features. Their extraction mandates a lot of cleaning and some recommended strategies like thinking were employed while extraction
7. REGEX library was extensively used to extract and arrange the data in sensible manner.
8.The architecture used for classification uses 1-dimensional convolutions. 
9. The motivation behind 1-d convolutions comes from the fact that 1-d convolutions are good at extracting sensible features from data which has sequential nature.
10. Since, nature of the task is text classification and the words have a spatial relationship with other words, usage of 1-d convolutions based architecture makes sense
11. There is an image, named 'model_doc' which shows the architecture used in a glance.
12  The model reached 70% validation accuracy in 24 epochs.
